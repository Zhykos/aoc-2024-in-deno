My 2024 Advent of Code made with Deno (I may not complete it though...): https://adventofcode.com/2024.

My results: ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️🚫 ; ⭐️🚫 ; ⭐️⭐️

It makes:
* 2 golden stars for 11 days (both parts done)
* 1 golden star for 2 days (only 1 part done)

Made with Deno: https://deno.com/.

Deno contest for Advent of Code: https://deno.com/blog/advent-of-code-2024.

Launch a specific test, for instance: `deno test --allow-read --filter "Day 6 part 1"`.

Some tests are ignored because they are too slow.
You can run all of them with `deno task test`, but it will not run the slow ones.

To run all tests, even the slow ones, use `deno task test-even-long`.
The ones that are ignored are not resolved yet or don't have a solution.
