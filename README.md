My 2024 Advent of Code made with Deno (I may not complete it though...): https://adventofcode.com/2024.

My results: ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️⭐️ ; ⭐️🚫 ; ⭐️🚫 ; ⭐️?

It makes:
* 2 golden stars for 10 days (both parts done)
* 1 golden star for 3 days (only 1 part done)
* 1 not tested star for 1 day

Made with Deno: https://deno.com/.

Deno contest for Advent of Code: https://deno.com/blog/advent-of-code-2024.

Launch a specific test, for instance: `deno test --allow-read --filter "Day 6 part 1"`.

Some tests are ignored because they are too slow. You can run all of them with `deno task test`.
