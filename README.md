It makes:
* 12 days done with 2 golden stars (both parts done)
* 2 days done with only 1 golden star (only 1 part done)
* 11 days not done yet

Launch a specific test, for instance: `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --filter "Day 6 part 1"`.

Some tests are ignored because they are too slow.
You can run all of them with `deno task test`, but it will not run the slow ones.

To run all tests, even the slow ones, use `deno task test-even-long`.
The ones that are ignored are not resolved yet or don't have a solution.
